### SHOPNOW Application  

**Description:**  
Developed a full-stack Shopping Application designed to deliver a seamless online shopping experience. The project was built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, ensuring a dynamic and efficient interface supported by a robust server-side infrastructure.  

**Key Features:**  
- **User Authentication:** Implemented secure sign-up and login functionalities using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and hashed passwords for data security.  
- **Product Listing and Filtering:** Designed an intuitive interface to display product catalogs with filtering options based on categories, price range, and ratings.  
- **Shopping Cart Management:** Enabled users to add, remove, and update items in their shopping cart dynamically, with real-time price calculations.  
- **Order Processing:** Built a streamlined order placement system with a backend API for handling order details, tracking, and confirmation.  
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured a mobile-friendly layout for smooth user interaction across devices.  
- **RESTful API Integration:** Developed RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express to manage products, users, and orders efficiently.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3  
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js  
- Database: MongoDB for storing user data, product catalogs, and order details  
- State Management: Context API/Redux for handling global state across the application  

**Challenges Addressed:**  
- Optimized performance for rendering large product catalogs using Reactâ€™s lazy loading and memoization techniques.  
- Ensured data security and API reliability with proper authentication and error handling.  

**Outcome:**  
Successfully delivered a user-friendly shopping platform, demonstrating strong capabilities in full-stack development. This project enhanced my skills in building scalable, secure, and responsive web applications while solidifying my expertise in React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.
